Playground to explore Julia


## Installation
To install Julia on my local machine for use in Jupyter notebooks, I followed these steps:
1. <a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">Download</a> the latest version of Julia directly from the developers.
2. Launch the Julia app and key in the following commands:
```
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("IJulia")
```

  This took about a minute to run on my machine.

3. You should now be able to launch Jupyter, and can create a notebook using Julia.
